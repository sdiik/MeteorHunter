### Meteor Hunter 
Meteor Hunter is a game I developed using UIKit and SpriteKit. SpriteKit is an Apple framework specifically designed for 2D game development, offering high performance and various features such as animations, physics, and graphical effects.

### Create
In this game, I used SKView, which is part of UIKit and serves as a container for displaying SpriteKit elements. All icons and sound effects in the game were sourced from free resources available on the internet, ensuring the use of legal and openly accessible assets.
